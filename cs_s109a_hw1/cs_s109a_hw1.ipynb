    "### Hints\n",
    "- You should include acting appearances in both movies and TV shows.\n",
    "- Create a variable that groups actors/actresses by the age of their first appearance. Use pandas' `.groupby` to divide the dataframe into groups of performers that for example started performing as children (age $<$ 12). The grouped variable is a `GroupBy` pandas object and this object has all of the information needed to then apply operations to each of the groups.\n",
    "- When cleaning the data make sure the variables with which you are performing calculations are in numerical format.\n",
    "- The column with the year may have some values that are double, e.g. **'2000-2001'** and the column with age has some empty cells. You need to deal with these in a reasonable fashion before performing calculations on the data. \n",
    "- Rita Aryu was born in 1993.\n",
    "- Be careful of some actors/actresses listings as producers.  We only want their acting appearances.\n",
    "- Christopher Nolan is mainly a writer and has never acted.  Be careful handling him (you should 'impute' the year of his first movie appearance as 2021).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Resources\n",
