    "**1.1** Load the data sets as follows:\n",
    "- 'covid_cases_county.csv' as `covid_raw` \n",
    "- 'vaccines_county.csv' as `vaccines_raw`\n",
    "- 'masks_county.csv' as `masks`\n",
    "- 'demographics_county.csv' as `demo` \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2** Create a subset of the `covid_raw` data frame that only contains the measures for 5 dates: June 27 and July 4, 11, 18 and 25.  Do the same for the `vaccines_raw`.  Call these subsets `covid` and `vaccines`, respectively, and print out their dimensions (aka, shapes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3** Determine and print the number of counties that are measured for each time period in `covid` and `vaccines` (do not print out the list of counties, just the number/count).  Comment on what this implies for presence of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4** Process both `covid` and `vaccines` so that each county is represented by a single row in each data frame (rather than having 5 separate rows for each county: 1 for each time period in part 1.2).  Call these new generate Pandas data frames `covid_by_county` and `vaccines_by_county` separately.  Print out the dimensions of each resulting data frame, and view the header of `covid_by_county`.  Note: you should use informative names for the columns in the resulting data frames: for example, `cases_w30` for the cumulative number of cases on July 25 (it's the 30th week of the calendar year).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Splitting based on dates and then using `pd.DataFrame.merge` (source)[https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html] could be helpful for this task using the `fips` code as the keys to join on (you should drop any counties that are not measured in all time periods...the default argument for `how` in `pd.DataFrame.merge` will behave this way).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.5** Merge the 4 data fames (`covid_by_county`, `vaccines_by_county`, `masks`, and `demo`) based on `fips` and save the result as `covid_merged` (you should drop any counties that are not measured in all 4 data frames).  Determine and report how many counties were dropped from `demo` in this process, and view the header of `covid_merged`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.6** Use `covid_merged` to calculate the novel case rate (per 1000 residents) for each of the weeks for all of the counties, and save these as 4 new well-named variables in `covid_merged`.  For example, `rate_w30` can mathematically be represented as `1000*(cases_30-cases_29)/population`.  Plot the histogram of the novel case rate in week 29, `rate_w29`, and comment on what you notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.7** We did the steps above (and some other minimal processing) and saved the results in `covid_clean.csv` for you.  Use this data file to answer some exploratory questions and all future analyses: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Has the overall average case rate increased from week 28 (July 5-11) to week 29 (July 12-18)?  \n",
    "2. Treating the counties as separate and equal observations: in what states did the case rate increase the most?  In what states did the case rate decrease the most (or increse the least)?  List the top 5 for each.  Do you notice any patterns in these states?\n",
    "3. Create and interpret separate visuals to display how the country case rate in week 29 relates to each of the following variables. Interpret what you see (be specific to this domain).\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The political views in the county (as measured by the votergap in the 2020 election).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. The vaccination rate in the county (for week 28) (be sure to throw away the zeros as these represent unreported values).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. The population density of the county.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Whether 50% or more of the surveyed residents in the county report that they always wore a mask in public at the time of the survey."

    "## Question 2 [35pts]: Regression modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "**2.1** Fit a linear regression model to predict `rate_w29` (which represent the rate of new cases in the week of July 12-18) from `rate_w28` (July 5-11). Report the 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients, and carefully interpret the coefficients (including their statistical significances).  What does this model suggest about whether the rate of COVID infection increased from week 28 to week 29?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.2** Fit a linear regression model to predict `rate_w29` from `rate_w28` and `votergap20` along with the interaction between the two.  Interpret the coefficient estimates carefully (no need to mention significances).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.3** Create a scatterplot of `rate_w29` vs. `rate_w28`.  Add 3 separate predicted lines from your model in 2.2 to this scatterplot: the predicted line from the model in 2.2 for counties...\n",
    "    1. where Biden was favored by 50 percentage points.\n",
    "    2. where Biden and Trump were equal\n",
    "    3. where Trump was favored by 50 percentage points.\n",
    "Interpret what you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.4** Fit a linear regression model to assess the overall association of vaccination rate (`fully_w28`) on `rate_w29`.  Carefully interpret the results (including the statistical significance).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.5** Many counties have the value zero for `fully_w28` which really represents a missing/unreported value for vaccinationr rate.

    "The intercept coefficient is very close to 0. Most of the effect is therefore between rate_28 and rate_29.\n",
    "The slope coefficient is estimated at 0.6603: for every increase in rate_28 for a county, we - on average - expect rate_29 rate to increase by 0.6603. As such - as the coefficient is less than one - this suggests the rate of COVID infection DEcreased from week 28 to week 29.\n",
    "When graphing the relationship however, it seems reasonable to conclude that the slope is underestimated, probably due to outliers on the bottom right. Note also that the R squared is 38.4%, indicating 38.4% of the variance in rate_w29 is explained by rate_28."

After controlling for votergap20 (and the interaction), the coefficient for rate_w28 is almost 1.19. This indicates that for every increase in rate_w28, rate_29 increased by 20% more.\n",
    "After controlling for the confounding factors, the regression graph 2.1.3 also looks more reasonable.\n",
    "The interaction variable indicates how different the slope for rate_w28 is as voter gap changes. As median votergap20 is negative, for each one change in voter gap, the slope for rate_w28 decreases by 0.01. This is  illustrated in graph 2.1.4 in purple. The graph also demonstrates how the purple line may be pushed down by outliers for counties Franklin, Powder River, and Loving, counties where Trump significantly outperformed Biden. R squared increases from 38.4 to 45.8 by adding votergap20 and the interaction with rate_28."

We also plotted the full range of dose1_w28 for each observation in the training set. We can observe that the graph shape for dose1_w28 varies only marginally between the observations. We can therefore conclude that limited interaction effects exist between dose1_w28 and other predictors."

In doing so, too many coefficients were reduced to 0.\n",
